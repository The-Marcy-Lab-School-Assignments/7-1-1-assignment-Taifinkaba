# Question

What are the benefits of single-page apps (SPAs) versus multi-page apps (MPAs)?

# Answer
SPAs loads a page faster since its only updating content dynamically and only the targeted parts. Since only targeted parts change the entire page doesnt need to reload or refresh which also reduces server loads.
