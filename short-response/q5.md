# Question

With React Router, which of the following path(s) will match the `/products/:id` path?

1. `/products`
2. `/products/apple`
3. `/products/5`
4. `/products/5/about`

Explain your answer.

# Answer
It will match  with 2  or 3 because they build off of  `/products` with more info but 1 leads no where and 4 goes further than `id`.
